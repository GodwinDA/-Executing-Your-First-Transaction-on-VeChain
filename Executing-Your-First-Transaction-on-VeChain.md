# Executing Your First Transaction on VeChain

## Introduction
Transactions are the foundation of any blockchain—they move value, trigger smart contracts, and record activity on-chain. On VeChain, transactions are powered by its unique two-token system: VET, which represents value, and VTHO, which covers gas fees. This design makes VeChain efficient and predictable for developers and enterprises alike.

In this guide, we’ll walk through how to execute your very first transaction on the VeChain blockchain. You’ll learn how to set up your environment, create a wallet, fund it with test tokens, write a simple transfer script, and verify the transaction—all with step-by-step instructions and without unnecessary complexity.
